Introducing a military operative codenamed Solid Snake, whose objective is to infiltrate the enemy's base and find and destroy the ultimate weapon, Metal Gear! Stealth is key, but if a certain clapping noise keeps alerting the guards you can also choose to confront the enemy with a wide selection of firearms and explosives. Weapons can not only be used to kill enemies, but also to clear obstacles such as hollow walls or electrified floors.

This disc was originally bundled with the Twin Snakes Premium Package in Japan, and contains an emulated NES Metal Gear as well as a game trailer for Twin Snakes.
